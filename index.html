        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        Welocme ot my site. This is my assignment for DCD 110 where I was tasked with creating a homepage for DCD 110. This class is probably gonna be easy for me since I have HTML coding experience from High School and also because I took DCD 201 last semester.

            In chapter 1 we learn about a program called “Spleak”. “Spleak” is an instant messaging platform that uses chat bots which assumptively use AI to sound humanistic. We learn that the author or whomever this chapter’s point of view comes from that this platform was the first friend to the author and not only helped her learn an unfamiliar language but sparked their imagination. In chapter two we meet Larry. Larry is an assistant web developer for a word press software company called zip space. In chapter 3 we meet Scott. Scott is Larry’s boss. We learn about Scott’s 4+ step plan for the company here.
