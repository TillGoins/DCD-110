        Welcome to my site. This is my assignment for DCD 110 where I was tasked with creating a homepage for DCD 110. This class is probably gonna be easy for me since I have HTML coding experience from High School and also because I took DCD 201 last semester.
        <h2> Reflection 1</h2>
        <p style="background-color:Tomato;">
            In chapter 1 we learn about a program called “Spleak”. “Spleak” is an instant messaging platform that uses chat bots which assumptively use AI to sound humanistic. We learn that the author or whomever this chapter’s point of view comes from that this platform was the first friend to the author and not only helped her learn an unfamiliar language but sparked their imagination. In chapter two we meet Larry. Larry is an assistant web developer for a word press software company called zip space. In chapter 3 we meet Scott. Scott is Larry’s boss. We learn about Scott’s 4+ step plan for the company here.

<h3> Relfection 2</h3>
<p> In Chapters 4 and 5 we learn more about the fictional charcter Larry and his expereinces. We beign talking about presenataions which are "digital containers to hold the ideas, thoughts and/or visuals of an artist, cultural institution, brand or [insert subject].
Their function is to archive information accumulated and maintained throughout the subject’s lifetime and represent the subject as a contained body that has a significant value on the market."(IMAMOVIĆ,25) What this sticks out to me as is the thought that websites are't just handmade froms cartch HTML anymore, there are poeple doing that so that other can take the easy route out. "most templates on the internet today follow the reading logic of a printed book. They have preceding and following pages, previous and new articles. When the user clicks through, their information-consuming experience is similar to that of flipping book pages. Except that, in the digital domain, all pages appear within the frame of a screen. Fixed components for navigation (i.e. menu) that appear across the pages are placed close to the corners of the screen so that they don’t disturb the reader’s focus of a single page."(IMAMOVIĆ,27) This line really stuck out with me because it's turly repsentative of what a modern website building process has become. 
In chapter 5, IMAMOVIĆ talks about how everyone wants a simple website an dnobody wants to take time and design a site. "Whether situated in a company or his bedroom, a web developer’s experience of life is defined by a set of time frames, each lasting about three to six months—depending on the client’s deadline to actually start making money." (IMAMOVIĆ,39) The developer is looking fo rmoney but in this new age struggles to make much because of deadlines and quick site buidlers like wix.
